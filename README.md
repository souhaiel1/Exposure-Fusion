## Abstract 
In this project, we present the implementation and investigation of a technique for
fusing a bracketed exposure sequence into a high-quality image, without the need
for physically-based HDR assembly. This technique, called ExposureF usion,
was introduced by T. Mertens, J. Kautz, F in their paper [Exposure Fusion](http://www.example.com) to visit example.com). Their approach simplifies the
image acquisition process by skipping the HDR assembly step, and is computa-
tionally efficient and versatile enough to include flash images in the sequence.
The technique blends multiple exposures in a multi-resolution fashion, guided by
quality measures such as saturation and contrast. The resulting image quality is
comparable to existing tone mapping operators and demonstrates the potential of
our proposed method.
